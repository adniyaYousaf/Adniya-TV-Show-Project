# Level 100

For level 100, we are going to display information about every episode of a single TV show.

## Requirements

1. All episodes must be shown
2. For each episode, _at least_ following must be displayed:
   1. The name of the episode
   2. The season number
   3. The episode number
   4. The medium-sized image for the episode
   5. The summary text of the episode
3. Combine season number and episode number into an **episode code**:
   1. Each part should be zero-padded to two digits.
   2. Example: `S02E07` would be the code for the 7th episode of the 2nd season. `S2E7` would be incorrect.
4. Your page should state somewhere that the data has (originally) come from [TVMaze.com](https://tvmaze.com/), and link back to that site (or the specific episode on that site). See [tvmaze.com/api#licensing](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#licensing).

Note: Provided your project meets the above requirements, it can **look** however you want. Do the simplest thing to begin with.

Here is one example layout.

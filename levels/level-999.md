# Extra options

Do not do any of these until you have completed level 500!

Here are some ideas for consideration for further work:
1. Add cast listing to your show listing, http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed=cast
2. Add cast listing to your episode listing, http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1?embed=cast
3. Allow clicking a cast member to present a view of all shows the person has appeared in http://api.tvmaze.com/people/1/castcredits
  - Linking those back into your episodes view of each show.
4. Truncate long summaries and provide a "... read more..." control to reveal more.
5. Allow the user to choose to have the show list sorted by rating (highest rated shows first)
6. Have your search support start-of-word search, or other search types.
7. Make the browser's back and forward buttons navigate through your changed views (see [History.pushState()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState)).
8. Allow user to mark "favourite" shows
9. Allow user to store notes on each episode
10. Use local storage to cache the above, and perhaps also to cache episode lists
11. Paginate through results with a "load more" button - don't load 100s of episodes at a time.
12. Experiment with infinite scroll
13. Responsive design
14. Style your page to fit the theme of the show (colours, typography, background images, etc). Commit to one show to do this.

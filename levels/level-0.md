# Level 0

The goals of level 0 are to:
* Create a GitHub repository with the starter scaffolding in-place.
* Deploy it to Netlify.
* Make sure whenever you push changes your Netlify site will be updated.

> [!WARNING]  
> Unlike other projects at CYF, you are not going to _fork_ this project, you're going to create a repository from a template repository.

## Create your repository

1. Go to https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JS3-Module-Project
2. Click on the green button: `Use this template.`
3. Name your new repo exactly this: `JS3-Module-Project`
4. Do not enable `Include all branches`
5. Click the final green button `Create repository from template`

## Deploy your site

1. Follow [the instructions to deploy your site to Netlify](https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/guides/deployment-netlify/).
2. Configure your site for auto-deployments.
3. Ensure your Netlify site is named exactly `cyf-USERNAME-tv.netlify.app` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username.

## Get set up on your laptop

1. Clone your repository
2. Open your repository in VS Code
3. Open the `index.html` page in Chrome
4. Make sure in Chrome you can see the text "Got 73 episode(s)" in red. If you can't, something has gone wrong.
5. Edit `index.html` to include your name and github username in the page title instead of "(My Name (My GitHub username))".

## Push your changes

1. Commit your changes to your `index.html` to your git repository (with a clear commit message).
2. Push your changes to your GitHub repository. Make sure they show up on GitHub.
3. Ensure your updated site has been deployed to Netlify.
